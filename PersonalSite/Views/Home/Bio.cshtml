Hi, my name is Brad Stratton and as you can probably tell, I'm a software developer.
Growing up, I was always fascinated by everything to do with computers and how they worked,
both hardware and software. So it seemed only natural that I follow that passion in to my
career. Recently graduated from Indiana University Southeast with a degree in Computer
Science, I am now doing just that.
